## smart shunt for treatment hydrocephalus
Hydrocephalus is a common congenital disorder of CNS (Central Nervous System) that may be presented in one out of
500 to 2000 children. It is also presented due to aging which cause dementia and gait (Walking) problems. CSF
production rate is 20 ml/h if it is not absorbed properly it causes hydrocephalus. The main treatment is a Shunt placement
(100,000 surgeries per year). Normal ICP in adults range from 5 to 15 mmHg (herniation may occur at 20 mmHg). Shunt
blockage in the first year ranges from 20% to 30%. For diagnoses an invasive procedure is used if not sure then surgery
for replacement is preferred, but this could be very expensive. ICP capacitive sensing with the kit tool can provide
pressure measurement, but the Smart Shunt with implantable and biocompatible flow sensor provide an efficient way
for diagnosing the blockage of the shunt, over-drainage, and under-drainage with much cheaper, safer, and 24/7 remote
monitoring system compared to the current technologies(e.g. MRI, CFD or ultrasound with contrast). These continuous
readings could lead to a better understanding of hydrocephalus treatment and better quality of life for the patients. The
Smart Shunt readings from the tilt sensor combined with ICP pressure sensor data confirm the patient position and the
future risks and alert him to change his posture if the ICP or flow rate increase (over drainage) which may be caused by
shunt failure and cause coma, stroke, seizure, or even death. The device harvest its power thought RF antenna and
additional electronics to power the device and transmit the data through passive telemetry. Smart shunt will provide
better care and ease for both the patient and the doctor as it will provide the necessary data for diagnosing the shunt
failure, high risk symptoms such as over drainage and increased ICP and separate it from other illnesses like flu reducing
the panic and rushing to emergency rooms every time the patient experience headache or feel dizzy. It also will provide
accurate readings for future development of the shunt and solving its failure causes.
